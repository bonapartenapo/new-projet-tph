            <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Why would I want to know that? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
            <p><strong>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</strong> <em> I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</em> Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
            <h2>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</h2>
            <p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Tell them I hate them. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>But existing is basically all I do!</li><li>When will that be?</li><li>She also liked to shut up!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</h3>
            <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. We don't have a brig. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!</p>
            <ul>
            <li>No, of course not. It was… uh…  Yeah, that's it.</li><li>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</li><li>Bender, we're trying our best.</li>

            <p>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>
            <p>You're going to do his laundry? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.</p>
            <p>Negative, bossy meat creature! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Say what? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
            <p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Shut up and get to the point! Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</p>
            <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
            <p>File not found. Professor, make a woman out of me. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I'm Santa Claus!</p>
            <p>Also Zoidberg. Who am I making this out to? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
            <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. When will that be? Do a flip! Leela's gonna kill me.</p>
            <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Who am I making this out to? Ask her how her day was. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
            <p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. And I'm his friend Jesus. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
     
        <p>Ask her how her day was. I love you, buddy! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Can I use the gun? Soon enough.</p>
